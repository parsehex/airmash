AIRMASH is a web game originally created by the developer named **Five Sigma**. Play the game by flying one of 5 aircraft around a 2D map of planet Earth and destroy enemy aircraft. Keyboard controls are WASD/Arrows + Shift/Control and Space.

I'm not well-known but I've been playing AIRMASH for about 7 years, using various but mostly meaningless [names](./names.md). From early on I loved how hackable the game was and how surprisingly active the modding scene was for a web game.

This project aims to provide links and information about the game Airmash as well as point to some of my so-called improvements that you can use to change how you play Airmash.

To be clear: **I did not create Airmash**, I'm simply enthusiastic about it and wish to build upon the awesome set of projects that the game is made of nowadays.

## [airmash-extensions](https://github.com/parsehex/airmash-extensions)

This is a collection of userscripts and Starmash extensions, some of which are forked from work by [fabiospampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato) and [Detect](https://github.com/Detect).

- [**Respawn Hotkey**](https://github.com/parsehex/airmash-extensions#respawn-hotkey) - Press **Shift** and one of the **numbers 1 thru 5** to respawn into a different aircraft.
- [**Laser Pointer**](https://github.com/parsehex/airmash-extensions#laser-pointer) (original by [fabiospampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato)) - Press **P** to toggle a straight line extending from the front of your aircraft.

## [airbattle-hosting](https://github.com/parsehex/airbattle-hosting)

This is a mono-repository which combines the [frontend](https://github.com/airmash-refugees/airmash-frontend), wight's [ab-server](https://github.com/wight-airmash/ab-server) and spatie's [ab-bot](https://github.com/spatiebot/ab-bot) into a single place.

- Host an Airmash server on your own PC
- (Experimental) An Electron wrapper is available which offers some UI controls like changing the game mode and number of bots.
  - You must [setup](https://github.com/parsehex/airbattle-hosting#setup) the project to run this. Since this whole thing is [unlicened](https://github.com/parsehex/airbattle-hosting#license), I will not be offering pre-built copies of this application.
