Nobody knows me but I've been playing AIRMASH for about 7 years, using rotating but mostly meaningless [names](./names.md). From very early on I loved how hackable the game was and how surprisingly active modding scene for a web game.

During my time playing this game I've made several of what I like to call "improvements" of my own.

## airmash-extensions

3 years ago I forked [fabiospampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato)'s [airmash-swam-extensions](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/airmash-swam-extensions) to fix the laser pointer extension and I've been modding Airmash ever since.

I don't use Starmash anymore so I rewrote the laser pointer to work as a userscript instead. I also have written at least one mod of my own for the game.
